## My process

Never giving up and keep pushing further like before, nothing changed.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox 
- Javascript
- and with bunch of Love.

### What I learned

Keep learning with every opprtunity. So far only completing Newbie level projects to lay that important foundation. Slowly but steady project experience and process is becoming much more smooth without me peeping anywhere.  In the following project I learned:

HTML: Learned how to create proper brand Icons with some cool visual effects

CSS: Nothing new

Javascript: Minor new tricks
